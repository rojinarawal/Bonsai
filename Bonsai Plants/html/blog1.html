                    <p> The technological landscape changes every year and it's our responsibility to stay up to date. In this blog, we discuss the rising trends that will alter the global environment over the coming year, as well as how they may effect you and your business.</p>

                <h2>On trends:Artificial Intelligence, Computing, Multimedia </h2> <br>

                <p><strong> Tech is the spark igniting creativity! </strong> From VR/AR to AI, it's a canvas for artists and a solution-driver for real-world issues.Artificial Intelligence, Computing, Multimedia : These three trends are establishing themselves as the prevailing themes for 2023, regardless of which blog you open. </p>
                
                <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3><br>
                
                <p> The global AI software market is estimated to grow at approximately 54% every year. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans.AI systems are capable of doing tasks including voice recognition, decision-making, problem-solving, and learning. It is used in a variety of areas, including healthcare and banking, to increase efficiency, accuracy, and personalisation. AI is transforming how we work, live, and interact with one another and the rest of the world.</p>
                
                <h4> Cloud Computing as the next level of abstraction</h4><br>
                
                <p> I'm fully aware that I spend a lot of time discussing the benefits of cloud computing for careers, but it also makes sense when it comes to problem-solving. <br> <br>
                    This is the next degree of abstraction in our business. <br><br> The evolution of software development has gone from machine language to assembly language, to compilers and high-level languages, to standard libraries and package systems, and now to serverless cloud services.This provides the capability to communicate effectively at scale, just as moving from rock and chisel to paper and typing improved communication methods.</p>
                
                <h5> Multimedia </h5>  <br> 
                
                <p> Multimedia is not just a new hype, it has become an essential tool in modern communication. Multimedia has become a crucial aspect of our everyday lives as a result of technological improvements and the increasing usage of the internet.When communicating, using text, graphics, audio, and video are all considered kinds of multimedia. The user experience is improved by the usage of this mix of media components, which makes it more dynamic and engaging.
                     Multimedia has evolved into a crucial tool in many industries, including entertainment, education, and advertising among others, thanks to the development of technology and the internet. </p>

Advancements in technology have led to new products and services, but also come with challenges such as cybersecurity and job displacement. It is important to use technology responsibly and consider its consequences.Overall, Technology continues to shape the world and its impact will only grow in the future.</p>
